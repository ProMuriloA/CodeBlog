            <h3>HTML, the foundational building block</h3>
            <p id="first-paragraph">As you start your coding journey you will face
                a lot of subjects, some are mandatory, some are not, it
                depends on your goals. But, the first step is of utmost importance.
                And the first step for a software developer is HTML. 
            </p>
            <p id="second-paragraph">Html stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to print
                text, images and content in general to a webpage in a website, it uses tags and and it has its own
                syntax, it is not a programming language but it is needed to create a webpage, without
                it, no content would show when you open a site. It is the "skeleton" of a 
                webpage.
            </p>
            <p id="third-paragraph">However, for the current webpages to run it is needed much more than just HTML.
                Which bring us to the next topic: CSS. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="second-section">
            <h3>CSS, adding style to a webpage</h3>
            <p>Without CSS webpages would be boring and colourless. CSS stands
                for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used for adding style to webpages 
                by creating rulesets and pairs of attribute and values. Furthermore,
                with CSS you can change the way pages look, moving elements of HTML
                 from one place to the other, adding animations and transitions and giving the
                  webpage a fun look so it can be shown to the user. By the way: I'm sorry, but
                  CSS is not a programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be thinking: "That's it?". No, that's not it. As you've seen, there is a lot
                of content we've got to cover. So, let's go ahead into our next topic
                (and a real programming language): Javascript.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="third-section">
            <h3>Javascript, that's where the fun actually begins</h3>
            <p>Javascript is a programming language. While learning it you will face other challenges, such as 
                programming logic, which encompasses: loops, conditionals, variables, functions, data types, classes
                 and other "interesting" stuff (it is only interesting if you like computers). 
                 Then you will learn how to do a lot of stuff with it, such as importing modules 
                 (you've got to learn what modules are first), doing nice mathematical stuff, creating stuff 
                 no one is gonna use (unless they really like computers and Mathematics).
            </p>
            <p>  Javascript is the most used programming language on the internet, specially in the front-end
                of the websites, without it, most of the websites would lose it's functionalities, withou Javascript
                all the pages would be static, static webpages resemble Wikipedia articles because they have content,
                however it is not very interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                After leraning the coding basics, programming logic and how to apply all of this to make an
                interactive webpage, testing and asynchronous Javascript you are going to learn actual coding
                 stuff, which bring us to the next topic: Frameworks.                   
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="fourth-section">
            <h3>Frameworks, lots of them!</h3>
            <p> There are a lot of frameworks for a lot of different purposes, but they all have something in common:
                They make coding easy, maintanable, cut a lot of unnecessary repetition and save a lot of time.
                 You will find many frameworks on your way to get a Front-end job. Make good use of them,
                  you're gonna use them all the time.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="fifth-section">
            <h3>Data Structures, beware!</h3>
            <p>Data Structures is the most complex of all, it involves mathematics and uses a programming language, such
                as JavaScript or Python, it is an important subject to study beacause it can make your website be fast or
                slow, it can make the website have problems or not. The correct use of Data Structures makes 
                websites work properly, the incorrect use of Data Structures can make the website work in a wrong way or not
                work at all.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="sixth-section">
            <h3>The End</h3>
            <p>I hope you liked this brief summary of the main subjects someone has to study in order to get a front-end 
                entry-job level. It can be a bit overwhelming to read this and try to image what it all means, but having
                a map of what you've got to study is important so you do not get confused. Thank you very much!
